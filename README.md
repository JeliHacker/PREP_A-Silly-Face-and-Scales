# PREP_A-Silly-Face-and-Scales
Create a webpage that has an SVG element. Within the SVG element use svg to draw a silly face. You are welcome to copy the face shown(on Moodle), or better yet encouraged to demonstrate your own talents.  Second write an essay to discuss what a scale is and provide two ways it is useful in visualization.
